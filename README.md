My solution of CarND-MPC-Project assignment from Udacity Self Driving Car nanodegree course, Term 2. See project assignment starter code in https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project

## Dependencies

The project compilation and work have been verified under Mac OX Sierra XCode 8.3.1. I used cmake 3.7.2 to build project files.

## Code Style

To enforce [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), I included Google's `cpplint.py` file available in `./src/Lint` folder. This tool expects installed python2.7. To check style of my code, run the following command line (from `./src/Lint`):

```
./cpplint.py ../*.h ../*.cpp
```

## Rubric Points

### The Model

### Timestep Length and Frequency

### Polynomial Fitting

### Model Predictive Control with Latency
